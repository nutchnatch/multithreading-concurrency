Apache Jmeter
    - allows us to create an automated performance test plan
    - load file which contains a list of words, each word will send an http request  and wait for the response
    - the tool will send as many request as possible and as fast as possible, and in the end gives the throughput of the app
    - throughput = #requests / time to get the response
    - We can clearly see that the performance keeps improving as we add more threads until we reach specific # of threads.
        At that point the performance plateaus and stays the same as more threads are added.
