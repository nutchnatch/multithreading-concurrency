The Object class in java contains the following methods:
    - wait()
    - notify()
    - notifyAll()

    - since every Java class inherits from the Object class, we can call those methods from any class
    - we can use any object as a conditional variable and lock (using synchronized keyword)

    - wait() - causes the current thread to wait until another thread wakes it up
        * in this state, that thread is not consuming any cpu
    - 2 ways to wake up a sleeping thread:
        + notify() - called from another thread; it will waits a thread waiting on that object
            - if many threads are waiting, only od them will be chosen arbitrarily
        + notifyAll() - awakes all threads waiting on that object
        + to call those methods, we need to acquire the  monitor of that object (use synchronized on that object)

    - whenever using a queue to decouple multithreaded components, apply back-pressure and limit the size of the queue
