Threads coordination
    - how can we guarantee that the threads upon which we depend completes its work by the time we expect
    - full control of other threads execution
    - tasks in parallel, significant speedup, safely correlate anf aggregate results

Why we do need
    - different threads run entirely independently
    - order of execution is out of control

Two threads (A, B), where B depends on thread A
    - Naive solution, busy way
        * tread B runs in a loop and keeps checking if thread A's result is ready
        * this approach is extremely inefficient  (thread B is burning cpu, counterproductive)
        * what we want is thread B to sleep and wait for thread A to finish and only then thread B wakes up to get the result
        * use tool Tread.join()

Notes:
    - never rely on the order of execution
    - always use thread coordination to get reliable results
    - design the code for worst case scenario
    - threads may take unreasonable time to finish
    - to solve, we pass the duration for the thread in join method
    - stop the thread if it is not done by that time
